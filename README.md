# Searchit plugin for Craft CMS 3

Configurable filters for enhanced element search in the Craft CP.

This plugin gives your CP users an extensive tool for searching/ filtering entries, categories, assets and users in the CP.

Uses and extends the Craft CP element [search](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/searching.html)

## Examples

You have two ways to setup filters. Manually or dynamically.

#### Assets

#### Entries

#### Categories



Tip: As with the regular Craft Search, if you suspect that your search indexes donâ€™t have the latest and greatest data, you can have Craft rebuild them with the Rebuild Search Indexes tool in Settings.
